# Stanford CS 242 Programming Languages

[Stanford CS 242](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs242/) Programming Languages has lecture slides online but no homework.
Fortunately [Rylan Schaeffer](https://rylanschaeffer.github.io) posted the homework assignments and his solutions as he took the course in 2022. Thanks, and congrats on your A-, Rylan!

This repo resets Rylan's to a state without any of his solutions. You can find Rylan's solutions in the `rylan` branch.
